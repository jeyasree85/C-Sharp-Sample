  <h2>Gas Safety Certificates</h2><p>When any gas appliance is installed or serviced, a gas safety certificate must be produced so the customer is given peace of mind that the boiler, gas fire or central heating system complies with all safety regulations.</p>

As you would expect from professional and skilled plumbers like us we are happy to provide a full 12 month guarantee on all of our pipework.

Over the years we have earned a growing reputation for our high standards of professionalism and a high level of dedication to customer care, as standard, that other companies simply struggle to match.

Depending on the urgency of the work and your location we can often provide same day appointments.

We have developed a way of working that puts the customer at the centre of everything we do from the moment you engage us, until the moment we leave. We provide a comprehensive and trustworthy, reliable service with transparent pricing that leads to excellent results and customer approval at all times.
               
			   The gas safety information tells you that the gas appliance or gas fitting has been checked, that it is working safely and meets the correct safety standards. This information will also be a reminder of when you next need to service the appliance. It’s important to get all gas appliances regularly serviced once a year, to ensure they are working efficiently and safely.
			   
			   Certainly in rental properties, it is a legal requirement that landlords must produce these for safety standards, ensuring that all new tenants, as well as long term lets, have all the regulation certificates necessary for their rental property. At Greener Plumbing and Heating we will always complete Gas Safety Certificates and will supply the private individual, businesses and landlords, with a copy of the gas safety certificate, showing due diligence and proving that the gas appliance is in good working order and safe to use.
If you are a landlord, then you will be responsible for the safety of your tenants. Landlords’ duties apply to all types of accommodation, occupied under a lease or licence, which includes:


<ul>
<li>Residential properties provided for rent by local authorities, housing associations, private sector landlords, housing co-operatives or hostels</li>
</li>Rooms let in bed-sit accommodation, private households, bed and breakfast accommodation and also hotels</li>
<li>Holiday accommodation such as rental chalets, cottages, flats, caravans and narrow boats on inland waterways.</li>

</ul>
