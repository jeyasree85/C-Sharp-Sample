					 <p>In order to get the best from your boiler system we recommend that you have your boiler serviced every year.

When choosing a company to undertake boiler servicing it is vital that you choose a company with skilled, qualified and dedicated engineers who are able to service all types of boilers.

We recommend annual servicing which has a number of benefits from ensuring that boiler problems are kept to a minimum to preventing more serious breakdowns from occurring in the future.

If you do not service your boiler on an annual basis it is likely to become less efficient and could break down more often. Additionally, there is a danger of ventilation problems, gas leaks and in certain circumstances a faulty boiler can be a source of carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas the effects of which can be fatal. If you are a landlord you are legally obligated to ensure that the gas appliances, fittings and flues you provide for tenants are safe.</p>
